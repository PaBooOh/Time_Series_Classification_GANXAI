Sensor data originally from Carlos Guestrin (CMU),used in the paper
<em>Online Latent Variable Detection in Sensor Networks</em> and
formatted for classification by Eamonn Keogh. The task is to
distinguish between sensor q8calibHumid (a humidity measure) and
sensor q8calibHumTemp (temperature). The data has dropouts. In the
original data the dropouts have value 0. This means they are
difficult to detect with normalised data.
